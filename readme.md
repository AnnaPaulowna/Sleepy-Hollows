<p align="center" style="color:beige;"><i>In <strong>Sleepy Hollows</strong>, shadows grow,<br>
Where mysteries and whispers flow.<br>
The cemeteries, cold and still,<br>
Hold secrets buried 'neath the hill.</i></p>

<p align="center" style="color:beige;"><i>A <strong>rider</strong> roams the haunted trails,<br>
With hollow eyes and armor pale.<br>
Infected plants, with twisted vines,<br>
Entangle dreams, distort the mind.</i></p>

<p align="center" style="color:beige;"><i>Old mansions loom, their windows black,<br>
Hiding what may not turn back.<br>
The <strong>rider’s</strong> curse, the plants’ cruel blight,<br>
Together weave the endless night.</i></p>

<p align="center">And with that, welcome to <em>Sleepy Hollows</em>!</p>

<p align="center">Discover a new biome, new structures, plants, and trees, new dangers, threats, and enemies!</p>

## Features:

- **The Sleepy Hollows**: A new, mystical biome. Characterized by thick fog, eerie gravestones, and ancient structures.
- **Wood and Plants**: What would a new biome be without its own wood, flowers, stones, and grass?  
  The biome feels... threatening to you. Be cautious and keep an eye on your sanity!
- **New Encounters**: Infected zombies roam the Sleepy Hollows, slightly stronger than regular zombies, and are the main foes of the biome.  
  For those with enough courage and the right gear, there's a new boss to fight: the Horseman.
- **New Gear**: Unique weapons and a new armor set await to be collected.
- **A... horse**. A very special one! I think.

Have fun exploring *Sleepy Hollows* and gathering new equipment.

Maybe, during your expeditions, you'll even uncover the secret identity of the Horseman!
